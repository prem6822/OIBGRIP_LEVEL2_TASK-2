              Ratan Naval Tata is an Indian industrialist, philanthropist, and a former chairman of
              Tata Sons. He was the chairman of Tata Group, from 1990 to 2012, and again, as interim
              chairman, from October 2016 through February 2017, and continues to head its charitable
              trusts.
            </p>
            <p>
              He is a heir of the Tata family, and son of Naval Tata who was later adopted by Ratanji
              Tata, son of Jamsetji Tata, the founder of Tata Group. He is an alumnus of the Cornell
              University College of Architecture and Harvard Business School through the Advanced
              Management Program that he completed in 1975.
            </p>
            <p>
              He joined his company in 1961 when he used to work on the shop floor of Tata Steel, and
              was the apparent successor to J. R. D. Tata upon the latter's retirement in 1991. He got
              Tata Tea to acquire Tetley, Tata Motors to acquire Jaguar Land Rover, and Tata Steel to
              acquire Corus, in an attempt to turn Tata from a largely India-centrist group into a
              global business. Around 60-65% of his profits are donated to charity making him one of
              the most significant philanthropists in the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              He is the recipient of two civilian awards of India, the Padma Vibhushan (2008), the
              second highest civilian honour, and the Padma Bhushan (2000), the third highest civilian
              honour.
